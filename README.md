# Error Recovery for Dialogue Active Learning

This repository contains experiments for applying active learning strategies for dialogue error handling. Specifically, we extend uncertainty sampling and error reduction methods to the partial feedback, selective sampling, and multi-instance settings.
Our most recent write-up can be found here on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e34166fd4449b00016cd549).

We build on Salesforce's GLAD model for dialogue state-tracking ([repo](https://github.com/salesforce/glad)), including GCE edits ([repo](https://github.com/elnaaz/GCE-Model)).
